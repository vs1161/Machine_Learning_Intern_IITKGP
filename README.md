# Feature Engineering 

Performed feature engineering which utilizes the atomic data and formula dataset to generate a new final formula dataset which is named here as final_formula_df which will be used to train the models 

The sample of the generated final formula dataset and the methods used during feature engineering are presented below for visualization
